## What is this repo

This repository is an attempt to learn and document F# and it's features. Bear with me, I'm mostly a C#/Typescript fella trying to learn some functional programming 😅

### Running

You'll need to have at least .NET 5 installed on your machine. Once that's done all you need to do is use the `dotnet` cli to `build` and `test`.

+ `dotnet build` builds the project
+ `dotnet test` runs all the tests within this project
